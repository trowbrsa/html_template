<h1> Projects </h1>

<p>
I am a digital strategist living in Seattle and a student of <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>,
cohort 4. From September 2015 through September 2016, I will be learning front-end web development with the end-goal of becoming a software developer.

<h4>Below are some of my recent projects from class:</h4>

<strong> <a href="https://gist.github.com/trowbrsa/d5348a1309c53da32b98">Random Menu Generator:</a> </strong>
  <p>A small program built in Ruby that offers you a random list of menu items based on user input.</p>

<strong> <a href="https://github.com/trowbrsa/BankAccounts">Bank Accounts:</a> </strong>
  <p>
    A short program that involves one module to manage multiple classes that operate based on the numbers initialized when
    a new object of that class is created.
