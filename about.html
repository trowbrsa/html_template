<h1> About Sarah </h1>

<section>
  I am a digital strategist living in Seattle and a student of Ada Developers Academy 4th cohort.
  From September 2015 through September 2016, I will be learning front-end web development with the end-goal
  of becoming a software engineer. I am also exploring how to increase digital equity in the city of Seattle
  through the Department of Neighborhoods Peoples Academy for Community Engagement program.
  My previous professional experience includes working on online marketing for a number of software startups.
